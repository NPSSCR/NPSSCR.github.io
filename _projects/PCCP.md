El plasma es el cuarto estado fundamental de la materia y el más común de todos. Aproximadamente el
99% del universo se encuentra en estado de plasma. Sin embargo, en la actualidad, gran parte de la
sociedad costarricense desconoce las características o la existencia de este estado de la materia.

El conocimiento del plasma y sus características es fundamental para comprender nuestro universo y
nuevas tecnologías emergentes, como la fusión nuclear controlada para la generación de energía limpia,
segura y sostenible o la exploración espacial. Es por esto por lo que el Capítulo Nuclear & Plasma
Sciences Society (NPSS), se ha planteado como uno de sus objetivos para el 2023, brindar
capacitaciones a estudiantes en temas de plasmas térmicos y no térmicos.

				<h5>Richard Kouzes, July 1998</h5>
<p>The Computer Applications in Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Technical Committee of the IEEE NPSS had its beginnings as an ad hoc committee formed after the Real-Time conference organized by Dennis Perry (LANL) in 1979 in Santa Fe. He organized the conference because he thought it had been too long since the Skytop real-time conference of 1969.</p>
<p>At the conference, a group of us decided that there was a need for such a conference on a more frequent basis, so we formed an ad hoc committee to organize the next conference and to carry out other activities to promote those active in real-time computing. The members of the committee (as best I remember) and their institutions at that time included Larry Cardman (U. Ill), Dave Hensley (ORNL), Dick Kouzes (Princeton), Creve Maples (LBL), Dennis O’Brien (LLNL), Dennis Perry (LANL), Bill Tippie (ANL), Lester Welch (ANL). The ad hoc committee organized the next conference in Oak Ridge for 1981, and also met on several occasions to begin activities such as creating a tape format for data storage (released as the CANPS format in 1987), and trying to obtain funding to set up a central repository for nuclear and particle physics software in the US.</p>
<p>The Berkeley (1983) conference was then organized by the ad hoc committee. The committee was contacted by someone from the IEEE at this point to ask if we would consider becoming a technical committee of the IEEE with a membership of the ad hoc committee plus a few members of an existing IEEE committee. The ad hoc committee felt this would be beneficial for the conference and our other activities, so in 1984, CANPS was born. The series of biennial conferences on Real Time Applications in Nuclear, Particle and Plasma Sciences has continued since that time.</p>
